openbve (1.2.1.3-0ubuntu1) unreleased; urgency=low

  A marker at the front of first car is now used for
  signalling/platform positioning, rather than first axle or "beacon
  receiver" offset.  this should allow the removal of workarounds in
  route/train models.

  The "defaultexterior" configuration option has been removed by
  upstream.  It is now always true and a version of the basic "model"
  from 'Data/Compatibility/exterior.csv' is used as the default 3D
  representation for the train in semi-invisible train front (the
  "pre-train")---this model is expected to be a unit cube, that is
  then scaled to the anticipated train height/width/length.

  The default (unspecified) train data has been adjusted:
  + CarHeight                   3.2 metres -> 3.6 metres
  + AerodynamicDragCoefficient  1.2        -> 1.1
  + CenterOfGravityHeight       1.5 metres -> 1.6 metres

  Others:
  * Boolean 'World.MouseGrabIgnoreOnce' used for working around Sdl.SDL_WM_GrabInput() bug.
  * Huge churn from renaming "SecuritySystem" to "SafetySystem".
  * debugCheckError() renamed to CheckForOpenGlError().
