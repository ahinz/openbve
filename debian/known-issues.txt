Known bugs/issues with running OpenBVE on Linux/Ubuntu/Debian.
==============================================================

Fixed and merged by upstream:
-----------------------------
2. If you have texture flashing issues; this is because the C-based
OpenGL code was receiving pointers to single integers from the
OpenBVE.  Fixed by passing a array.  Fixed upstream by passing
components separately.

3. Crashes out whilst trying to promisicously read non-accessible
directories (eg. '/lost+found' or '~/.dbus').  It is hunting
for directories containing a valid 'train.dat' description file.
Kludged for the moment with try{}catch{} to not die.

15. Window manager icon loading was not handled.

5. Non-existant audio; sound should work the first time, but after
quitting OpenAL complains about uncleaned-up buffers.  You will
likely need to 'kill -9 pulseaudio', although this may not recover
the situation.  Something in OpenAL/SDL isn't being cleanly shutdown.
You may get the occasional sound afterwards on second/third attempts
but not the full multi-channel surround experience.

6. Captialisation.  The routes have a combination of UPPER, lower, and
MiXeD cAsE filenames which is a problem on Unix.  The file-loading
routinues need modifying to search for alterntively cased files if
the filename as spelt can't be found.

7. The London Undergrond cab 'LT_C69_77' appears in the centre of
the screen in OpenBVE, meaning that you can't see where you're going.
As a work-around, you may able to unlock the cam and move yourself up
a bit to look over the top of the console.  Sort-of-fixed in 0.9.5.5.  
(Though you will need to unlock the camera and zoom out to see any of 
the panel).  This is to do with the camera-restriction box algorithm
used in OpenBVE.

8. The sprites Gauges in cabs displayed are not displayed correctly,
instead showing a different/stretched part of the overlay with blue
tinting from the edges of the alpha mask.  Clipping/position broken.
You will have to rely on the small rectangle OpenBVE overlays
('EMG/B3/B2/B1/N/P1/P2/P3') instead.

21. 'Security system warning', this refers to signalling system, not
to the program trying to perform anything naughty!  As extension DLLs
are not being available on Linux.  Patched to only display a warning
*if* an 'ats.cfg' was present .  This avoids the Issues dialogue on an
otherwise error-free route/train.

22. Hidden dot files/folders (those starting with '.') are clutter
the filemanager.  Patched to skip listing dot-files;  you can
still type the full name in.  May be worth restricting to only
!Platform.Windows.

26. British English and flag should be en-GB/GB (not 'en-UK/UK').

21. In full-screen on Linux, the mouse-cursor (pointer) remains visible in
the centre of the screen.

Fixed with outstanding patches:
-------------------------------
4. Trying to write the directory the executable is in; On Unix this is
likely to be owned by route.  Modified to use the CLR SpecialFolder
functions and save configuration data in the right places.

14. Loading fails if 'Train/' and 'Railway/' do not share a common parent
directory at some point.  # Disabled the check for 'Train/' as it is
not actually used later (loading works fine when a Train/ and Railway/
are in separate locations.

Remaining:
----------
1. The binary 'OpenBve.exe' binary compiled by Michelle for MS Windows
may crash out of the box; hopefully this patched recompile doesn't!
(Whether this is true depends on the particular release!)...

9. The preview images for trains and route in the file-manager screen
display random binary data if the preview image isn't found (normally
from being the incorrect case).  This also applies to flag icons.

10. Crashes if you provide correct  openbve /train=... /route=...

11. Crashes if you provide incorrect openbve /train=... /route=...

13. Pressing "Show issues" during a route with loads of reported issues
causes 100% CPU.

16. After selecting an exterior camera view and then switching back to
the interior camera; the cab/panel overlay appears in a different position.

17. CPU load goes up to 100% is OpenBVE is obscured from view
(eg. Alt-tab to another program).

18. ExitToMainMenu causes a fork() and return (leaving the user at the
command prompt and daemonising the second instance into the background)
rather than using exec() or restarting itself.  This crashes OpenBVE.
It needs openbve to pass "/fhs" back to itself if it was handed it.

19. The program may sometimes display "route not found" or "train not found"
even when the correct files do exist.  clicking on another route/directory
and then clicking back works around it, so this is probably a race condition.

20. No way reset the Train (and camera) to be upright after a crash.  You
should drive more carefully next time!

22. Excessive re-drawing of the listview boxes causes the interface to lag
(particularly noticable when typing in the route selection path box.

23. If the Train/ and Railway/ do not share and immediate common parent
directory, the external view (may) not be loaded.

24. Route-specific Timetable overlays try to be loaded from
Train/somewhere/../../Railway/Object/...  rather than directly from
Railway/Object/...

25. After a route is selected in the listview, the circular "busy"
mouse pointer may stay busy even after loading is completely.  As
a workaround, move the mouse-pointer out of the listview rectangle
and back in again.

26. On closing, it may go into an infinite loop waiting on a futex
(100% CPU).

27. First noticed in 1.0.2.0; alpha shading under bridges and lampposts
will flicker and may be yellow instead of gray.  Other people have noticed
similar issues since at least 0.9.3.3:
http://openbve.freeforums.org/texture-colouration-in-xcs-t445.html

28. First noticed in 1.0.2.0; the formLoading dialogue is not getting 
Diposed() (closed/destroyed) when the main Game Window opens and
hangs around in the background without being redrawn.

In-progress:
------------
12. Language Locale not automatically set by default;  patched to  use
System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name as default, but
needs refining to cope with 'll_CC' not just 'll' language codes.
This is done on first-load but then forcifully saved in the options
even if the user has not manually selected a language (prevents
future automatic language selection working).
