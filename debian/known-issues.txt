Known bugs/issues with running OpenBVE on Linux/Ubuntu/Debian.
==============================================================

Fixed and merged upstream:
--------------------------
1. The binary 'OpenBve.exe' compiled by Michelle for MS Windows
will crash out of the box;  hopefully this recompiled binary
will work.

2. If you have texture flashing issues; this is because the C-based
OpenGL code was receiving pointers to single integers from the
OpenBVE.  Fixed by passing a array.  Fixed upstream by passing
components separately.

3. Crashes out whilst trying to promisicously read non-accessible
directories (eg. '/lost+found' or '~/.dbus').  It is hunting
for directories containing a valid 'train.dat' description file.
Kludged for the moment with try{}catch{} to not die.

15. Window manager icon loading was not handled.

7. The London Undergrond cab 'LT_C69_77' appears in the centre of
the screen in OpenBVE, meaning that you can't see where you're going.
As a work-around, you may able to unlock the cam and move yourself up
a bit to look over the top of the console.  Sort-of-fixed in 0.9.5.5.  
(Though you will need to unlock the camera and zoom out to see any of 
the panel).  This is to do with the camera-restriction box algorithm
used in OpenBVE.

6. Captialisation.  The routes have a combination of UPPER, lower, and
MiXeD cAsE filenames which is a problem on Unix.  The file-loading
routinues need modifying to search for alterntively cased files if
the filename as spelt can't be found.

Fixed with outstanding patches:
-------------------------------
4. Trying to write the directory the executable is in; On Unix this is
likely to be owned by route.  Modified to use the CLR SpecialFolder
functions and save configuration data in the right places.

21. 'Security system warning', this refers to signalling system, not
to the program trying to perform anything naughty!  As extension DLLs
are not being available on Linux.  Patched to only display a warning
*if* an 'ats.cfg' was present .  This avoids the Issues dialogue on an
otherwise error-free route/train.

22. Hidden dot files/folders (those starting with '.') are clutter
the filemanager.  Patched to skip listing dot-files;  you can
still type the full name in.  May be worth restricting to only
!Platform.Windows.

Remaining:
----------
5. Non-existant audio; sound should work the first time, but after
quitting OpenAL complains about uncleaned-up buffers.  You will
likely need to 'kill -9 pulseaudio', although this may not recover
the situation.  Something in OpenAL/SDL isn't being cleanly shutdown.
You may get the occasional sound afterwards on second/third attempts
but not the full multi-channel surround experience.

8. The sprites Gauges in cabs displayed are not displayed correctly,
instead showing a different/stretched part of the overlay with blue
tinting from the edges of the alpha mask.  Clipping/position broken.
You will have to rely on the small rectangle OpenBVE overlays
('EMG/B3/B2/B1/N/P1/P2/P3') instead.

9. The preview images for trains and route in the file-manager screen
display random binary data if the preview image isn't found (normally
from being the incorrect case).

10. Crashes if you provide correct  openbve /train=... /route=...

11. Crashes if you provide incorrect openbve /train=... /route=...

13. Pressing "Show issues" during a route with loads of reported issues
causes 100% CPU.

14. Loading fails if 'Train/' and 'Railway/' do not share a common parent
directory at some point.

16. After selecting an exterior camera view and then switching back to
the interior camera; the cab/panel overlay appears in a different position.

17. CPU load goes up to 100% is OpenBVE is obscured from view
(eg. Alt-tab to another program).

18. ExitToMainMenu causes a fork() and return (leaving the user at the
command prompt and daemonising the second instance into the background)
rather than using exec() or restarting itself.

19. The program may sometimes display "route not found" or "train not found"
even when the correct files do exist.  clicking on another route/directory
and then clicking back works around it, so this is probably a race condition.

20. No way reset the Train (and camera) to be upright after a crash.  You
should drive more carefully next time!

21. In full-screen on Linux, the mouse-cursor (pointer) remains visible in
the centre of the screen.

22. Excessive re-drawing of the listview boxes causes the interface to lag
(particularly noticable when typing in the route selection path box.

In-progress:
------------
12. Language Locale not automatically set by default;  patched to  use
System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name as default, but
needs refining to cope with 'll_CC' not just 'll' language codes.
