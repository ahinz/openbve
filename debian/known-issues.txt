Known bugs/issues with running OpenBVE on Linux/Ubuntu/Debian.

Fixed:

1. The binary 'OpenBve.exe' compiled by Michelle for MS Windows
will crash out of the box;  hopefully this recompiled binary
will work.

2. If you have texture flashing issues; this is because the C-based
OpenGL code was receiving pointers to single integers from the
OpenBVE.  Fixed by passing a array.

3. Crashes out whilst trying to promisicously read non-accessible
directories (eg. '/lost+found' or '~/.dbus').  It is hunting
for directories containing a valid 'train.dat' description file.
Kludged for the moment with try{}catch{} to not die.

4. Trying to write the directory the executable is in; On Unix this is
likely to be owned by route.  Modified to use the CLR SpecialFolder
functions and save configuration data in the right places.

Remaining:

5. Non-existant audio; sound should work the first time, but after
quitting OpenAL complains about unclened up buffered.  You will
likely need to 'kill -9 pulseaudio' if you having that running.
You may get the occasional sound afterwards on second/third attempts
but not the full multi-channel surround experience.

6. Captialisation.  The routes have a combination of UPPER, lower, and
MiXeD cAsE filenames which is a problem on Unix.  The file-loading
routinues need modifying to search for alterntively cased files if
the filename as spelt can't be found.

7. The London Undergrond cab 'LT_C69_77' appears in the centre of
the screen in OpenBVE, meaning that you can't see where you're going.
As a work-around, you may able to unlock the cam and move yourself up
a bit to look over the top of the console.

8. The displayed controller in the London Underground 'LT_C69_77' cab
does not work correctly in OpenBVE.  Each state on the combined
power/brake index is a separate sprite in the same image, but the
clipping is currently wrong.

9. The preview images for trains and route in the file-manager screen
display random binary data if the preview image isn't found (normally
from being the incorrect case).

10. Crashes if you provide correct  openbve /train=... /route=...

11. Crashes if you provide incorrect openbve /train=... /route=...

In-progress:

12. Language Locale not automatically set by default;  patched to  use
System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name as default, but
needs refining.
