Known bugs/issues with running OpenBVE on Linux/Ubuntu/Debian.

Fixed:

1. The binary 'OpenBve.exe' compiled by Michelle for MS Windows
will crash out of the box;  hopefully this recompiled binary
will work.

2. If you have texture flashing issues; this is because the C-based
OpenGL code was receiving pointers to single integers from the
OpenBVE.  Fixed by passing a array.

3. Crashes out whilst trying to promisicously read non-accessible
directories (eg. '/lost+found' or '~/.dbus').  It is hunting
for directories containing a valid 'train.dat' description file.
Kludged for the moment with try{}catch{} to not die.

4. Trying to write the directory the executable is in; On Unix this is
likely to be owned by route.  Modified to use the CLR SpecialFolder
functions and save configuration data in the right places.

Remaining:

5. Non-existant audio; sound should work the first time, but after
quitting OpenAL complains about unclened up buffered.  You will
likely need to 'kill -9 pulseaudio' if you having that running.
You may get the occasional sound afterwards on second/third attempts
but not the full multi-channel surround experience.
