Description: Native (.so) loader for recompiled BVE Traimsim plugins
 OpenBVE is a railway/train simulator designed to be backwards
 compatible with existing 'BVE Trainsim' routes and cab interiors.
 Compiled plugins are used to customise the behaviour of the trains
 and their signalling systems.
 .
 Note that most BVE train plugins are distributed as binary DLLs for
 MS Windows and thus cannot be loaded using this proxy.
