As of 2009-04-05 (Sunday), version 1.0.2.0 has been released. This is a bugfix release, and while you are unlikely to see any changes with most existing routes and trains, you should still update in order for the few existing and upcoming routes and trains that were affected to appear and operate normally and as intended by the developer.<br /><br />Existing routes that were affected by some problems include:<br /><br /><table cellspacing="0"><tr>
<td valign="top">●</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>On the Birmingham Cross City South line, the door indicator did not work correctly and the buzzer did not sound at Redditch.</td>
</tr></table>
<table cellspacing="0"><tr>
<td valign="top">●</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>On the London Underground Northern line, the visual feed at stations did not work at the first station on the route.</td>
</tr></table>
<table cellspacing="0"><tr>
<td valign="top">●</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>On the Tokyo Metro Ginza line, the station preview indicators did not work at Shibuya and at Asakusa.</td>
</tr></table>

As of 2009-03-29 (Sunday), version 1.0.1.0 has been released, which is a small maintenance release that fixes some issues and makes some small changes here and there. This page is an overview of what has changed for the average user. For the full list of changes, please see the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a>.<br /><br /><table><tr style="height: 4px;"><td /></tr></table>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="#808080" height="24" style="background-image:url(../common/gradient_24.png)">
<font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;Stop indicator&nbsp;</font>
</td></tr></table>
<table><tr style="height: 4px;"><td /></tr></table>
The stop indicator was previously shown in <em>Expert</em> mode, which was not intended. From now on, it is only shown in <em>Arcade</em> and <em>Normal</em> modes.<br /><br /><table><tr style="height: 4px;"><td /></tr></table>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="#808080" height="24" style="background-image:url(../common/gradient_24.png)">
<font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;Camera&nbsp;</font>
</td></tr></table>
<table><tr style="height: 4px;"><td /></tr></table>
The camera settings are now preserved for <em>Interior</em>, <em>Exterior</em> and <em>Track</em> viewing modes. This means that if you switch between the views, your old camera position and direction is remembered when you go back to that mode.<br /><br />For trains which are equipped with exterior views that also contain the passenger section of the train, this is particularly useful as you can view as a passenger, go back to the cab and return to the passenger view without having to readjust the camera.<br /><br />The same holds true for the track view. As the track view is decoupled from the movement of the train, you can go to a station, bridge or other piece of scenery, switch back to interior or exterior views, and then jump back to where you left off the track view. The fly-by views are also considered a track view in this context. In order to line up the track view with the train again, reset the camera by pressing the CAMERA_RESET (num 5) key.<br /><br /><table><tr style="height: 4px;"><td /></tr></table>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="#808080" height="24" style="background-image:url(../common/gradient_24.png)">

</td></tr></table>
<table><tr style="height: 4px;"><td /></tr></table>
Warning and error messages can appear after loading a route and a train and are intended to help developers in their development process. While previous versions only showed a subset of the available range of messages, this version now brings back the full range of messages.<br /><br />As the average user though, you are probably not very interested in reading these messages, which is why you can now disable them in the <em>Options</em> menu. Developers, however, are strictly encouraged to leave these settings enabled in order to spot potential problems in their add-ons.<br /><br /><table><tr style="height: 4px;"><td /></tr></table>

</td></tr></table>
<table><tr style="height: 4px;"><td /></tr></table>
Some issues have been addressed for Linux users. First of all, while you could select a route and train to drive, the program could crash on some computers when trying to enter the simulation. This was related to the icon that is displayed in the top-left corner of the game window, which did not load correctly.<br /><br />Second, a series of in-game graphics, including the speedometer and pressure gauge needles, were not loaded correctly, leading to pixle garbage when trying to display them. These graphics have now been resaved in a different format that should load and display correctly on Linux.<br /><br /><table><tr style="height: 4px;"><td /></tr></table>
<table><tr><td bgcolor="#808080" height="24" style="background-image:url(../common/gradient_24.png)">
<font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;Mac OS X users&nbsp;</font>
</td></tr></table>
<table><tr style="height: 4px;"><td /></tr></table>
Currently, the ALUT or FREEALUT libraries are not available in a binary form on Mac OS X, which means that the sound subsystem cannot be used. However, as the sound subsystem was always initialized by previous versions of openBVE, the program would crash with the message of a missing component.<br /><br />As a temporary solution, you can now entirely disable the sound. Go to the <em>Settings</em> folder and open the <em>options.cfg</em> file with a text editor. Find the <em>[sound]</em> section and modify it to this:<br /><table><tr><td width="16" valign="top">▶</td><td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="border:1px dashed;">
<tt>[sound]<br />
usesound = false</tt>
</td></tr></table>
